## Day 1

- Estimated completion time: ~3 minutes

Easy peasy. Got snagged for a minute on parsing the empty line between each elf which was a bit silly.

## Day 2

- Estimated completion time: ~20 minutes

Hard-coding ftw. Fumbled a lot on trying to figure out a more dynamic strategy before deciding to simply hard-code everything. I'm TOO TIRED!!

## Day 3

- Estimated completion time: ~15 minutes

Spent a long time fumbling over part 1 because I wasn't sure if I had understood the question correctly (unique duplicates or just all duplicates?) - my solution kept coming up with a number that was way too high then randomly output the right answer without any change on my part that I knew of. Part 2 went down on the first try (about 2 minutes) which is atypical for me.

## Day 4

- Estimated completion time: ~15 minutes

This 5am thing is really biting me. Trying to get the logic right when I can barely think is a bit of a monster...

## Day 5

- Estimated completion time: ~30 minutes

As ever, long time deciding how to parse input in a half-asleep haze. Though each step of the way lots of debugging and figuring out but it did go down smoothly. Getting harder but still fun.

## Day 6

- Estimated completino time: ~15 minutes

Surprisingly easy that we're near a week into the challenge, should have finished a lot faster but got snagged on the looping/deduping logic which I think I'd have done much faster in JavaScript. It being 5am still doesn't help...

Also, didn't know about sets in python / that they were that similar to JS. This is how we learn!!
